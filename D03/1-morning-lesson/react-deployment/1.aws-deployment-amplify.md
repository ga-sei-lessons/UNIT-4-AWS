# AWS Deployment Using Amplify

This lecture is focused on deploying a React app using AWS Amplify.

 We will be covering the following topics:

- using IAM to create users/groups
- create and configure an S3 bucket
- connect to the S3 bucket via our terminal
- add a new startup script to build & push the React app

## AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a set of products and tools that enable mobile and front-end web developers to build and deploy secure, scalable full-stack applications, powered by AWS.

## Free Tier

Amplify falls into the **12 Months Free** tier of services so lets take a look at their [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/?all-free-tier.sort-by=item.additionalFields.SortRank&all-free-tier.sort-order=asc) page search for Amplify to confirm this is still the case.

We are presented with several ways to deploy the app from an existing code repository.  Since we will be using **Github** choose that option.

Amplify now needs to authenticate to Github so click on the **Authorize aws-amplify console** button.

<!-- We must now choose the repo that contains our project.
