# Intro To AWS And The Cloud

The adoption of cloud computing has quickly become a key driving force for businesses today, as applications are moved out of on-premise data centres in a bid to innovate, cut costs and increase agility.

AWS is the premier **Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)** provider and leads the market for cloud computing.

 AWS can host and maintain the core infrastructure, including hardware, software, servers and storage on behalf of a customer and provide all needed services, all highly available and scalable, where customers are only charged for the infrastructure and services they use.



## Intro To The AWS Global Network 

AWS has become the premier cloud service provider and provides companies with a global infrastructure and pay as you go service model helping companies to lower their TCO. 

Their infrastructure currently contains 24 geographic Regions around the world with a total of 77 Availability Zones. They have also announced plans for 6 more AWS Regions in Australia, India, Indonesia, Japan, Spain, and Switzerland which will includes 18 Availability Zones.

Let's take a closer look at the **N.Virginia Region**. **Regions** are used to aggregate and/or segment many of the services, as well as provide a level of redundancy using one or more Availability Zones.

 Their network also has **Point Of Presence** locations that increase the availability of services and reduces latency by geographically placing those locations in closer proximity to the end users.

### AWS Services

AWS offers in the range of 175 products and services. We can browse those services via the **Products** tab on [https://aws.amazon.com/](https://aws.amazon.com/).

The image above depicts a small scale implementation.  These are the services we will touch on during  of AWS where the following services are being used: 

#### AWS IAM - Identity and Access Management

AWS IAM is used to manager users, groups, roles across your entire AWS platform.

#### Amazon API Gateway 

The API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish, maintain and secure APIs.  It allows them to create standalone **APIs** that can integrate with other AWS services, such as Lambda, in order to provide a full backed infrastructure. 

#### AWS Lambda

AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.  With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero administration.

#### Amazon DynamoDB

Amazon DynamoDB is a key-value and document database that delivers single-digit millisecond performance at any scale. It's a fully managed, multi-region, multi-active, durable database with built-in security, backup and restore, and in-memory caching for internet-scale applications. 

#### Amazon CloudWatch

CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS and on-premises servers.
